pwn this locally!

you can either run it with docker compose:

$ sudo docker compose up

or just run the binary locally by itself

**note**

you can approach this exercise two ways:

1) treat it as a BLIND pwn as if you only have the remote
2) treat it as a pwn with the option of reversing the binary
